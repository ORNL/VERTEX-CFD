The steady, laminar separation bubble on a long plate, L/t ≥ 8, grows in size with increasing Reynolds number reaching a maximum streamwise length at Ret = 325. The separated shear layer becomes unsteady and the bubble shrinks in size with further increases in Reynolds number. The leading and trailing edge separation zones on short plates, L/t ≤ 4, may combine to form a large recirculation pocket.}",

abstract = {We propose a new activity on verification and validation (V&V) of MHD codes presently employed by the fusion community as a predictive capability tool for liquid metal cooling applications, such as liquid metal blankets. The important steps in the development of MHD codes starting from the 1970s are outlined first and then basic MHD codes, which are currently in use by designers of liquid breeder blankets, are reviewed. A benchmark database of five problems has been proposed to cover a wide range of MHD flows from laminar fully developed to turbulent flows, which are of interest for fusion applications: (A) 2D fully developed laminar steady MHD flow, (B) 3D laminar, steady developing MHD flow in a non-uniform magnetic field, (C) quasi-two-dimensional MHD turbulent flow, (D) 3D turbulent MHD flow, and (E) MHD flow with heat transfer (buoyant convection). Finally, we introduce important details of the proposed activities, such as basic V&V rules and schedule. The main goal of the present paper is to help in establishing an efficient V&V framework and to initiate benchmarking among interested parties. The comparison results computed by the codes against analytical solutions and trusted experimental and numerical data as well as code-to-code comparisons will be presented and analyzed in companion paper/papers.}

title = {Toward full simulations for a liquid metal blanket: part 2. Computations of MHD flows with volumetric heating for a PbLi blanket prototype at Ha ∼ 104 and Gr ∼ 1012},
journal = {Nuclear Fusion},
abstract = {On the pathway toward full simulations for a liquid metal (LM) blanket, this part 2 extends a previous study of purely magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) flows in a DCLL blanket in reference Chen et al (2020 Nucl. Fusion  60 076003) to more general conditions when the MHD flow is coupled with heat transfer. The simulated prototypic blanket module includes all components of a real LM blanket system, such as supply ducts, inlet and outlet manifolds, multiple poloidal ducts and a U-turn zone. Volumetric heating generated by fusion neutrons is added to simulate thermal effects in the flowing lead–lithium (PbLi) breeder. The MHD flow equations and the energy equation are solved with a DNS-type finite-volume code ‘MHD-UCAS’ on a very fine mesh of 470 × 106 cells. The applied magnetic field is 5 T (Hartmann number Ha ∼ 104), the PbLi velocity in the poloidal ducts is 10 cm s−1 (Reynolds number Re ∼ 105), whereas the maximum volumetric heating is 30 MW m−3 (Grashof number Gr ∼ 1012). Four cases have been simulated, including forced- and mixed-convection flows, and either an electrically conducting or insulating blanket structure. Various comparisons are made between the four computed cases and also against the purely MHD flows computed earlier in reference Chen et al (2020 Nucl. Fusion  60 076003) with regards to the (1) MHD pressure drop, (2) flow balancing, (3) temperature field, (4) flows in particular blanket components, and (5) 3D and turbulent flow effects. The strongest buoyancy effects were found in the poloidal ducts. In the electrically non-conducting blanket, the buoyancy forces lead to significant modifications of the flow structure, such as formation of reverse flows, whereas their effect on the MHD pressure drop is relatively small. In the electrically conducting blanket case, the buoyancy effects on the flow and MHD pressure drop are almost negligible.}
