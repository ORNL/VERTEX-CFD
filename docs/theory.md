## Governing equations

VERTEX-CFD implements the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, a temperature equation, and a magneto-hydrodynamics (MHD) equation (induction-less equation).


## The discretized equations

The governing equations are discretized with a finite element method (FEM). The resulting ordinary differential equations (ODEs) are integrated with a fully implicit temporal integrators from the Tempus package.

VERTEX-CFD employs a finite element discretization method and high-order implicit temporal integrators to integrate partial differential equations (PDEs)
