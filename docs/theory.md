## Governing equations

VERTEX-CFD implements the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, a temperature equation, and a magneto-hydrodynamics (MHD) equation (induction-less equation).

 $$
\begin{align}
\left\{
\begin{matrix}
    \nabla \cdot \mathbf{u} = 0 \\
    \partial_t \rho \mathbf{u} + \rho (\mathbf{u} \cdot \nabla) \mathbf{u} = -\nabla P + \rho \nu \Delta \mathbf{u} - \rho \mathbf{g} \beta (T - T_0) \\
    \rho C_p \left( \partial_t T + \mathbf{u} \cdot \nabla T \right) = \nabla \cdot (k \nabla T ) + q^{'''}.
\end{matrix}
\right.
\end{align}
$$


## The discretized equations

The governing equations are discretized with a finite element method (FEM). The resulting ordinary differential equations (ODEs) are integrated with a fully implicit temporal integrators from the Tempus package.

VERTEX-CFD employs a finite element discretization method and high-order implicit temporal integrators to integrate partial differential equations (PDEs). Numerical stability of the solution is ensured by the use of L-stable implicit temporal integrator and the use of appropriate mesh density.

## Boundary conditions

Boundary conditions are weakly imposed by computing numerical flux at the boundaries' provided boundary values.
